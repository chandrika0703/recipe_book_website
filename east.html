            Thekua, a traditional dish of Jharkhand, has deep roots in ancient history, dating
            back to the region's tribal communities. Originating as a sacred offering to the
            Sun God during Chhath Puja, Thekua has evolved into a popular snack enjoyed
            year-round. Its preparation involves wheat flour, jaggery, and ghee, symbolizing

    <div class="box2">
        <h2>METHOD</h2>
        <p>
            <li >To prepare this recipe, put a deep-bottomed pan on medium flame and boil 2
                cups of water in it. After a boil, add sugar in the water and stir till it melts.
                Once the sugar is melted, switch off the burner and put down the pan.</li>
            <li>Add ghee in the sugar syrup and stir to mix. Allow the syrup to cool at room
                temperature.</li>
            <li>Now, take a dough kneading plate and add wheat flour in it along with grated
                coconut, fennel and cardamom powder. (You must take whole wheat flour. It gives
                an amazing taste to the Thekua and is healthier too.) Mix well and then add the
                sugar syrup in batches to knead the dough. Make sure the dough is not too soft.
                It has to be hard or your Thekua will make like pooris!</li>
            <li>When the dough is ready, make small balls with your hands. Press them flat, you
                can use a cookie cutter to give them shape. You can also emboss a design on them
                if you wish to make them look attractive.</li>
            <li >Now, put a kadhai on high flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough,
                add a flattened piece of dough and deep fry them till golden brown in colour.
                You must keep the flame low so that the Thekua is cooked from the inside. Repeat
                the procedure and deep fry the remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Thekua is ready! Cool them at room temperature and store in air-tight containers.</li></p>

        <p>
            <li>Wash the prawns thoroughly & De-vein them.
                To prepare this Chingri Malaikari, remove the hard shell but leave the tail on.
                De-vein the prawn. For this, slit the back a little and take out the black thread.
                Carefully remove only the front portion of the head. Do not remove the entire head
                and retain the liquid inside.</li>
            <li>Marinate prawns with turmeric and salt, and make onion paste.

                Heat oil and throw in the prawns. Fry till pink and cooked on both sides and
                keep aside. In the same oil, add the chopped garlic. As soon as you can smell
                the garlic, take it out from the oil. So, the oil is now garlic flavoured without

            <li>Add prawns to the gravy and cook.
                When you see the oil surfacing on the gravy, add the fried prawns. Cook on low

                For making biryani we always choose to keep the pieces little big in size,
                as It should be 4 to 6 pcs of whole chicken.</li>
            <li>Take a bowl with 1/2 cup of curd or tokdoi, then add 1 tsp of kashmiri chilli
                powder and and 1/2 tsp of salt. Mix it well together.</li>
            <li>Once the mixing is done then add it to the chicken pieces, then add 2 tsp go
                garlic paste, 1 1/2 tsp ginger paste and mix it well together.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 tsp of powdered biryani masala(prepared earlier) and mixed it nicely
                with the chicken.</li>
            <li>Now squeeze 1/2 lemon(medium size) to mix its juice for marinating the chicken
                pieces.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add a handful of fried onions and mix it together. Now marinate
                chicken for at least 45 mins to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>After 45 minutes to 1 hour, take the same pan used for frying onion, place it
                on medium flame, then put the marinated chicken to the pan. Let it cook.</li>
            <li>After 5 mins turn down the pieces and cook it for 10 minutes by covering the
                pan with a lid.</li>
            <li>Again turn the chicken pieces and cook it for the next 8-10 minutes, but donâ€™t
                cover it then. I donâ€™t add water to it, but you may add a little if you
                wish to.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat when the gravy of this chicken will mostly dry up.</li>
            <h3>Preparing rice for biryani:</h3>
            <li>Take 1 kg basmati or long grain rice, wash it gently for 5-6 times and then
                soak it up for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, take a big vessel with its 3/4 of water, place it on high
                flame. Add salt, refined oil in it with bay leaves, green cardamoms, cloves,
                cinnamon sticks(break into 3-4 pieces). Let the water boil.</li>
            <li>When the water starts boiling then strain the soaked rice and add it to the
                water. Let the rice boil in water.</li>
            <li>While cooking the rice must check it frequently as rice can not be cooked more
                than 80 percent. Then turn off the heat and immediately drain the starch from
                the rice.</li>
            <li>Then you may spread the rice in some plates and completely cool it down. This
                procedure will prevent the rice from overcooking. Once the rice totally cools
                down then keep it aside.</li>
            <h3>Prepare saffron milk:</h3>
            <li>Take warm milk in a bowl, add a pinch of saffron strands or kesar or zaffran
                and let it soak for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes, when saffron strands get soft and almost leave its color
                in milk, then first use your fingertips to rub the strands to release more
                color from it. Even you may use a little saffron color if the strands donâ€™t
                leave a strong strain into the milk.</li>
            <li>Then add kewra or Keora water and 3 drops of rose essence one by one.</li>
            <li>Lastly add, 8-9 drops of mithaattar (not more than that) to the milk, and mix
                it well. Keep it aside for using it later.</li>
            <h3>Assemble Kolkata biryani:</h3>
            <li>Take a thick bottom wide mouth vessel. First, make it dry, then first spread
                the bay leaves in the bottom of the vessel.</li>
            <li>First spread 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch thick layer of rice on the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Then place two chicken pieces and three pieces of aloo on the first layer of
                rice. Mainly used leg pieces, though thatâ€™s not mandatory but you may use
                breast pieces too. Then add 3-4 tbsp of chicken gravy on the rice and chicken
                pieces.</li>
            <li>Now first sprinkle 1/2 tsp biryani masala all over the layer. Then sprinkle
                3-4 tsp of essence or flavour added saffron milk all over the layer.</li>
            <li>Next, sprinkle 2-3 tsp of ghee from the top of the layer. Lastly, sprinkle a
                handful of crispy fried onion on the layer and half tsp of salt. The first
                layer is complete.</li>
            <li>Then add rice from the top to completely cover. Then again assemble the next
                layer with the same process described just before. Again cover the second layer
                with white rice and make the third layer in the same way.</li>
            <li>Lastly, cover the last layer with an ample amount of rice to make sure nothing
                can be visible from the top.</li>
            <li>Then end up the assembling process by sprinkling 3-4 tsp of ghee, a pinch of
                biryani masala(not more than that) from the top. Lastly add salt and the
                hard-boiled eggs on the top of the rice and close its lid.</li>
            <h3>Put biryani on Dum:</h3>
            <li>Place the biryani vessel on the lowest heat of the oven. And place another
                pan on the top of the biryani vessel full of hot water.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™ll take a maximum of 30 minutes-45 minutes to be perfectly done. Or when
                the outer side and the lid of the vessel will be so hot that you cannot touch
                it also, that indicates your biryani is done.</li>
            <li>Then turn off the heat. Kolkata special chicken biryani is ready to serve,
                serve it with a side dish, or just with salads.</li>
