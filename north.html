            Its history can be traced back to the Mughal era when the Mughals ruled over Kashmir.
            The word â€˜modurâ€™ is derived from the Persian word â€˜modarâ€™ which means sweet. This dish is essentially
            a sweet rice pudding and was considered a royal delicacy in the Mughal court. The dish was introduced
            to Kashmiri cuisine during the Mughal rule and has been an integral part of Kashmiri cuisine ever 
            since. Modur Pulao is made with fragrant basmati rice, which is cooked with a variety of spices 
            such as cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves.

            <h2>METHOD</h2>
            <p>
                <li >Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cold water for 20-30 minutes.
      In a pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, cloves, and salt to the water.</li>
      <li>Drain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook the rice for 15-20 minutes until it is tender and fluffy.
      While the rice is cooking, heat the ghee in a separate pan. Add the cashews to the pan and fry them until they are golden brown. Remove the cashews from the pan and set them aside.
      In the same pan, add the raisins and fry them until they are plump and golden. Remove the raisins from the pan and set them aside.</li>
      <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and add the sugar to the rice. Stir the rice gently until the sugar dissolves.
      Add the fried cashews and raisins to the rice and stir gently to combine.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot with a lid and let the rice rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This will allow the flavours to blend and the rice to absorb the sweetness of the sugar.
      Garnish the Modur Pulao with more cashews and raisins before serving.</li></p>

        <div class="box2">
            <h2>METHOD</h2>
            <p>
           <li >You need cooked/boiled chickpeas for this recipe. The best way is to first 
            soak chickpeas overnight and then boil them in salt + turmeric water. Alternatively,
             you can also cook them in an Instant Pot where you need not soak them the night before..</li>
 <li>Simply add the dry chickpeas, cover it with 3-4 inches of water above it, then add salt and 
    turmeric powder and cook in manual mode for 24 minutes with natural pressure release. Once the 
    chickpeas are cooked, strain use the water to make aquafaband keep them aside for now.</li>
 <li>In a bowl add yogurt, all-purpose flour or maida, chilly powder, turmeric powder, coriander and
     cumin powder. Whisk it all together until smooth. Heat oil in a pan and fry cumin seeds along with
      asafoetida for 30 seconds. Then add cinnamon, peppercorns, cloves and cardamon along with minced
       ginger and garlic. Continue to fry for another minute.</li>
 <li>The actual Chana Madra recipe doesn't call for any greens in the recipe but since I had some beet
     leaves, I decided to add that as well in my curry to make it more nutritious. You can skip this
      step if you wish to.Also add half of the chopped cilantro along with the beet leaves and cook it
       for 2 minutes or until the leaves turn soft. Then lower the flame and add the prepared yogurt
        mixture to the pan. Mix it immediately.</li>
    <li>This is an important step, you have to make sure that you stir continuously and do not allow
         the yogurt to curdle. Cook this curry for 4-5 minutes on low flame. Then add the boiled 
         chickpeas along with salt. Mix and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>To thicken the curry, make a paste of rice flour and water and add to the pan. Stir and 
        garnish with chopped cilantro and ghee. Chana Madra is ready. Serve with any Indian bread/rice.</li></p>

            Phaanu, a traditional dish from Uttarakhand, has deep historical roots dating back centuries.
            Originating in the mountainous regions, Phaanu was initially a nutritious meal for shepherds
            and villagers, crafted from locally available ingredients like lentils, particularly Gahat
            (Kulath) lentils. Its preparation involved slow cooking over wood fires, allowing the flavors
            to meld and intensify. Over time, Phaanu became an integral part of Uttarakhand's culinary
            heritage, symbolizing sustenance and resilience in the face of harsh mountain climates.
            Passed down through generations, this dish embodies the cultural essence of Uttarakhand,

    <h1 class="kh">DAAL BATI CHURMA</h1>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;font-size: x-large;">History</h2>
            
            An authentic dish from Rajasthan, dal baati churma is quite popular in the region.
            The interesting origins of this classic dish arise from the time of wars. The dish
            has three parts and so does its history. The baati was brought in by Bappa Rawal to
            feed the soldiers of the Mewar kingdom. The dough of wheat was left to bake in the sun
            while the soldiers were away at war. On their return, they could eat it with fresh curd.
            Similarly, the churma followed when one of the cooks of the Guilhot dynasty dropped some
            sugarcane juice on the baati and it was realised that the baati tasted softer due to it.
            Finally, dal entered the trio last when the panchamel dal of a royal chef impressed the Guptas of Mewar.
            These three came together to form a dish that was meant to provide nutrition to soldiers during battles.
            A traditional Rajasthani dish, the spicy dal balanced the flavours of the sweet churma and hard baati.
